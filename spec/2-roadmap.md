### Deep Matching (v0.5)

- [x] LLM deep match (Stage 2) — LLM evaluates top ~10–20 fast-filter candidates using full posting + profile text
- [x] Multi-role matching — LLM identifies distinct roles in a posting, matches candidates per role separately
- [x] Match explanations (premium) — human-readable explanation of match quality (tier-gated, cached)
- [x] Hard filter enforcement — two-stage: hard filters (context, category, skill, location, availability) then soft scoring
- [x] Tree-aware skill filtering — parent skill selection includes all descendants via recursive CTE (`get_skill_descendants`)

### Text-First Syntax (v0.6)

Shipped alongside v0.7–v0.8 Spaces work. See [1-text-first.md](1-text-first.md) §3a, §3b, §6.

- [x] `mesh:` link syntax (editor) — CodeMirror decorations for `[📍 text](mesh:location?...)`, render as styled tappable chips, hide URL in edit mode
- [x] `mesh:` link syntax (view) — MarkdownRenderer strips `mesh:` URLs, renders display text with emoji
- [x] Slash commands emit `mesh:` — `/time`, `/location`, `/skills` overlays emit `mesh:` link syntax instead of emoji+text
- [x] `||hidden||` syntax — editor: dimmed + lock icon. View: placeholder for non-accepted, revealed for accepted. Parser for inline and block forms
- [x] `/hidden` command — inserts `||...||` block with cursor inside. Added to slash command registry
- [x] Profile calendar promotion — calendar connect UX moved from Settings into Profile's availability section
- [x] Settings page slimming — calendar removed from Settings. Danger zone = delete account only
- [x] Mobile command bottom sheet — "/" button near editor opens bottom sheet with command list on mobile
- [x] `/update` command — NL instruction command for profile/posting context. LLM applies changes to text + re-extracts structured fields

### Spaces Phase 1: Structural Rewrite (v0.7)

The core model change — messenger with Spaces, posting-messages, and matching/invite machinery. See [1-spaces.md](1-spaces.md) and [designs/spaces-rewrite.md](designs/spaces-rewrite.md) §16.

- [x] New DB tables — `spaces`, `space_members`, `space_messages`, `space_postings`, `space_join_requests`, `space_invites`, `activity_cards`. RLS, triggers, FTS indexes
- [x] 3-tab navigation — Spaces / Activity / Profile bottom bar (mobile) + sidebar (desktop)
- [x] Space list UI — filters (All/DMs/Groups/Public/Pinned), search, pins, unread badges, last-message previews, realtime updates
- [x] Space view — conversation timeline with posting-cards inline, auto-scroll, load-more
- [x] Compose area — message/posting toggle, inline posting fields (category, capacity, deadline, tags, visibility, auto-accept)
- [x] Posting-messages — create postings within Spaces, auto sub-Space generation, posting browser for large Spaces
- [x] Join requests — submit, accept, reject, waitlist. Auto-accept. Activity card on request
- [x] Invite batches — sequential/parallel modes, ordered list, pending/declined tracking. Activity cards for invitees
- [x] Activity tab — personal cards (match, invite, join_request, scheduling, rsvp, connection_request) with realtime subscription
- [x] State text — collapsible banner, admin-editable
- [x] Read tracking — DB trigger increments `unread_count`. Auto mark-as-read on fetch
- [x] Realtime messaging — Supabase Realtime per-Space channels. Optimistic updates
- [x] Presence & typing indicators — typing indicators hook (`use-space-presence`) wired to compose area
- [x] Activity card side-effects — `actOnCard` dispatches real actions: accept/reject join requests, accept/decline invites, navigate to matches
- [x] Invite response API — endpoint for invitees to accept/decline invites. Advances sequential invites on decline
- [x] Global Space + DM seeding — migration creates Global Space row and DM Spaces for existing connections
- [x] Posting-only mode enforcement — compose area checks `settings.posting_only` and locks toggle to posting mode
- [x] Member management UI — admin controls in space-info-sheet: remove members, change roles. Last-admin guard
- [x] Posting lifecycle UI — status transitions (close/fill), edit dialog, delete with confirmation
- [x] Realtime postings — realtime subscription in `use-space-postings` via `subscribeToSpacePostings`
- [x] Sub-Space thread rendering — reply counts via RPC, "View Thread" link on posting cards, back navigation to parent
- [x] DM Space creation flow — auto-create 2-person Space on connection accept. Idempotent with duplicate detection
- [x] `visible_from` enforcement — RLS policy `space_messages_select` filters messages by member `visible_from` timestamp
- [x] Matching → Spaces integration — embedding pipeline wired for `space_postings`. Matching triggered after embedding. Activity cards include space navigation
- [x] Space search (FTS) — `search_space_messages` RPC with security invoker, API endpoint, search UI in space header
- [x] Space context in deep matching — parent Space `state_text` propagated to deep-match and profile-to-posting LLM calls
- [x] Conversation summary in card suggestions — last ~5 messages passed to card suggestion LLM calls for conversational context

### Spaces Phase 2: Rich Interactive Cards (v0.8)

The card system replacing back-and-forth coordination. See [designs/spaces-rewrite.md](designs/spaces-rewrite.md) §16.

- [x] `space_cards` table — card state tracking (active, resolved, cancelled). `vote_on_card` RPC for atomic voting
- [x] Card types — time proposal, RSVP, poll, task claim, location. All 5 types with creation dialogs and rendering
- [x] Card rendering — interactive cards in conversation timeline with live vote updates via Supabase Realtime
- [x] Card actions — vote, change vote, cancel, resolve. Per-card controls for creator/admin
- [x] Card creation dialogs — RSVP (title + threshold), Task Claim (description), Location (place name). Fixed options per spec
- [x] Auto-resolve on consensus — time proposals: all members voted + clear winner. RSVP: Yes votes >= threshold. Task claim: first claimer
- [x] Calendar event creation — resolved time proposals create Google Calendar events for connected participants (fire-and-forget, best-effort)
- [x] Space archiving UI — archive/unarchive in space-info-sheet (admin). Archived section in space list with filter chip
- [x] Cross-Space promotion UI — "Promote to Explore" button on posting controls. Creates linked posting-message in Global Space

### Intelligent Prefill & Scheduling Intelligence (v0.8)

Calendar-aware card suggestions, smart prefill, chained flows. Implements the Card Principles ([1-spaces.md](1-spaces.md) §7) and Intelligent Coordination Flows ([0-use-cases.md](0-use-cases.md) §"Intelligent Coordination Flows"). Full design: [designs/intelligent-prefill.md](designs/intelligent-prefill.md).

- [x] Fused detect-and-suggest LLM — single Flash Lite call. Receives messages + calendar overlap + `||hidden||` profiles. Returns card type + prefilled data + member notes
- [x] Suggest API calendar enrichment — fetch member profiles (availability, timezone, source_text), calendar busy blocks, compute N-way overlap, extract `||hidden||` text via `parseHiddenBlocks()`
- [x] Structured slot format — time proposal slots store `{label, start, end}` (not just string labels). Calendar integration reads structured dates
- [x] Duration inference — LLM infers activity duration from message context (coffee → 30 min, dinner → 2h). Stored in card data. Calendar events use actual duration
- [x] RSVP threshold intelligence — default threshold = `ceil(memberCount × 0.6)` instead of hardcoded 2
- [x] Specific-time detection — "Let's meet at 2" + all members free → RSVP (not time proposal). Conflicts → time proposal with alternatives
- [x] Card suggestion UX — cheap client-side detector flags coordination intent while typing; user picks card type from chips; LLM generates prefill on tap. Auto-fills manual "+" menu from context
- [x] Calendar context strip — compact horizontal day view on time proposal cards showing surrounding events. Per-user rendering from `calendar_busy_blocks`
- [x] Card deadlines — `deadline timestamptz` on `space_cards`. Defaults: time_proposal 12h, RSVP 24h, poll 24h. Display: "Closes in 8h". Auto-resolve on-read when deadline passed
- [x] Detection prompt improvements — disambiguate task_claim vs. poll, declarative RSVP vs. negotiation
- [x] Decline-and-suggest — RSVP "No" vote triggers alternative time suggestions to voter and card creator via Realtime
- [x] Chained card flow — card resolution triggers follow-up: time resolved → suggest location, poll resolved → suggest time proposal. Pushed via Realtime
- [x] Private constraint notes — per-member notes on time proposal cards. Generated by fused LLM, stored in card `data.member_notes`. Only own notes visible
- [x] Profile `||hidden||` rendering — CodeMirror decoration: dimmed style + lock icon for `||...||` blocks in profile editor
- [x] `/hidden` slash command in profile — wraps selected text in `||...||` or inserts empty block. Available in profile context

## Milestones

> **Direction**: [1-text-first.md](1-text-first.md) defines the text-first philosophy; [1-spaces.md](1-spaces.md) defines the Spaces model. Where this roadmap and the behavior specs conflict, the specs take precedence.

### v0.9 — Polish & Completion

Consolidates remaining items from v0.7–v0.8 that were deferred when those milestones shipped, plus small gaps.

#### Spaces cleanup

| Feature                            | Effort     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Inherited → independent transition | Small      | Auto-set `inherits_members = false` when outsider joins via matching/invite.                                                                                                                   |
| ~~Old table cleanup~~              | ~~Medium~~ | ~~Partial~~ — `conversations`, `messages`, `group_messages`, `group_message_reads` dropped. Code migrated to `space_postings`/`space_members`. `postings` table drop deferred (FK dependents). |
| Conversation summary in matching   | Small      | Pass last ~5 Space messages to deep-match LLM calls (already done for card suggestions, missing for matching).                                                                                 |
| Space context in card suggestions  | Small      | Propagate parent Space `state_text` to card suggestion LLM calls (already done for deep matching, missing for card suggestions).                                                               |

#### Card system completion

| Feature                    | Effort | Description                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Trade-off card type        | Medium | "No perfect option — pick one" card with creator selection.                                                   |
| Card invalidation Phase 2a | Medium | Explicit actions only — buttons on cards (supersede, update).                                                 |
| Auto-archive (30-day)      | Small  | Cron-based auto-archive after 30 days of no messages. Infrastructure exists (manual archive shipped in v0.8). |

#### UX & integration gaps

| Feature                                | Effort     | Description                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ~~`\|\|hidden\|\|` acceptance gating~~ | ~~Medium~~ | ~~Done~~ — `revealHidden` wired via `useAcceptedPostingIds` hook. Owners + accepted see hidden content; others see placeholder.        |
| Quick-send suggestion path             | Small      | Suggestion chips currently always open the edit dialog. Add 1-tap quick-send path that creates card directly with pre-filled defaults. |
| Scheduling preferences onboarding      | Small      | Profile setup prompt: "Anything we should know when scheduling?" Auto-wraps in `\|\|...\|\|`. Skippable.                               |
| Remove chips & nudges remnants         | Small      | Finish cleanup of deprecated quick chip / post-write nudge code (`chipMetadata` marked deprecated but not removed).                    |

### v1.0 — Mobile (Capacitor, Android)

Minimal native Android shell wrapping the hosted web app. iOS deferred — PWA covers iOS users.

**Approach:** Hosted URL mode — the Capacitor WebView loads `https://meshit.app`. See [mobile_support_capacitor.md](../.prompts/mobile_support_capacitor.md) for UX considerations.

| Feature                          | Issue | Effort | Description                                                                                       |
| -------------------------------- | ----- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Capacitor init + Android project | —     | Small  | `npx cap init`, add `android/` project, `capacitor.config.ts` pointing at hosted URL              |
| Splash screen + status bar       | —     | Small  | Native splash screen, status bar theming (`@capacitor/splash-screen`, `@capacitor/status-bar`)    |
| Android back button + deep links | —     | Small  | Hardware back nav + universal links (`@capacitor/app`)                                            |
| App icons + store listing        | —     | Small  | Icon sizes, screenshots, Play Store metadata, keystore, `gradlew bundleRelease`                   |
| Platform detection utility       | —     | Small  | `Capacitor.isNativePlatform()` helper — suppress PWA install prompt in native shell               |
| Android push notifications (FCM) | —     | Medium | Firebase Cloud Messaging via `@capacitor/push-notifications`. Replaces web push in native context |

### v1.1 — Launch

| Feature               | Issue | Effort | Description                                                                          |
| --------------------- | ----- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Email + push notifs   | #14   | Large  | Email and push delivery channels (in-app already implemented)                        |
| Match pre-computation | #13   | Large  | Background pre-computation for instant match results at scale                        |
| LLM cost tiering      | —     | Medium | Tier models by feature: cheap for format, mid for extraction, high for deep matching |
| Production hardening  | —     | Large  | Performance audit, error monitoring, rate limiting, security review                  |

### v1.2 — Post-Launch

| Feature                      | Issue | Effort       | Description                                                                                                             |

## Explorations

Design areas that need deeper thinking before they become milestones. See `designs/` for detailed notes.

- **Continuous profile building & failure-driven context capture** — profiles grow from usage (postings, acceptances, rejections) rather than upfront forms. Coordination failures (no matches, cancelled invites, exhausted sequences) become prompts for adding constraints or profile context. See `designs/continuous-profile-and-failure-recovery.md`.

---

## Backlog (Unprioritized)

These are ideas without a target milestone. They'll be prioritized as the product evolves:

- `||?||` interactive prompts (Medium) — parsing and schema prepared (`parseQuestionBlocks()`, `AcceptanceQuestion` type). No UI renders `||?` blocks as interactive form elements on acceptance. LLM form generation needed
- Card invalidation Phase 2b (Large) — free-text detection: LLM reads messages against active cards, suggests updates. Deferred from v0.8; depends on Phase 2a
- Multi-role matching pipeline (Medium) — LLM identifies roles and returns `matched_role` per candidate, but matching evaluates once per candidate. Per-role pipeline with separate scores not yet implemented
- Text-first profile redesign (Large) — replace form-based profile view with unified MeshEditor, always-editable. Partially started (MeshEditor component exists, profile still shows form-based `ProfileView`). Originally v0.6; needs re-scoping for Spaces architecture
- Unified posting card (Medium) — consolidate posting card variants (`PostingBrowserCard`, `PostingCardInline`) into one component with `full`/`compact` variants. Originally v0.6; needs re-scoping for Space-based card architecture
- Mobile FAB (Small) — spec calls for floating "+" button fixed above bottom bar on mobile. Current implementation has "New Space" button in header instead
- Title as first line (Small) — remove separate title field, first line renders as heading. Originally v0.6; needs re-scoping for posting-messages within Spaces
- Auto-location detection (#16) — detect user location from IP for matching defaults
- Real-time voice upgrade — streaming voice input (OpenAI Realtime, Gemini Live)
- Auto-generated thumbnails — generate posting thumbnails from text via Gemini
- Analytics dashboard for posting owners
- iOS Capacitor build — Apple Developer account, Xcode signing, App Store listing (deferred; PWA covers iOS)
- Standardize date formatting across the app (#44)
- Add skeleton/spinner loading states for slow connections (#48)
- Configurable matching weights — weight sliders per posting (revisit after deep matching)

## Update Protocol

### Versioning Scheme

- **Semver**: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (currently `0.x.y`, pre-launch)
- **Minor bump** (`0.x.0`): when a milestone's features are complete and merged to `main`
- **Patch bump** (`0.x.y`): bug fixes and small improvements merged to `main`
- **Major bump** (`1.0.0`): public launch
- **Where tracked**: `package.json` version field + git tags (`v0.2.0`)
- **When to tag**: on merge to `main` that completes a milestone

### Keeping This File Current

1. **Feature PRs**: when your PR implements or completes a roadmap item, update this file:
   - Mark the item `[x]` and move it to "Implemented"
   - If it was the last item in a milestone, bump the version in `package.json`
2. **New issues**: when opening a GitHub issue for a planned feature, add the issue number to the relevant milestone row
3. **CI enforcement**: a warning is emitted on `feat/` PRs that don't touch this file (non-blocking)
4. **Quarterly review**: revisit milestone assignments and priorities at least once per quarter
