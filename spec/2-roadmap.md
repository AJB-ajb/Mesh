## Milestones

> **Direction**: [1-text-first.md](1-text-first.md) defines the text-first philosophy; [1-spaces.md](1-spaces.md) defines the Spaces model that replaces the posting-centric architecture. Milestones v0.7+ are organized around the Spaces rewrite. Where this roadmap and the behavior specs conflict, the specs take precedence.

### v0.6 — Text-First Rendering & Syntax

The editor and rendering system adopt the new markdown syntax (`mesh:` links, `||hidden||`, `||?||`) and the text-first card rendering philosophy. See [1-text-first.md](1-text-first.md) §3a, §3b, §6. Some items (e.g., `mesh:` syntax, `||hidden||`) may be folded into v0.7 Spaces Phase 1.

| Feature                        | Issue | Effort | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Unified PostingCard            | —     | Medium | Consolidate PostingCard, PostingDiscoverCard, PostsCard into one component with `full`/`compact` variants. Text is the hero element.                                                                                                            |

| Match score: Discover only     | —     | Small  | Hide match score badges outside of Discover feed. Score still drives ranking.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `mesh:` link syntax (editor)   | —     | Medium | CodeMirror decorations for `[📍 text](mesh:location?...)` — render as styled tappable chips, hide URL in edit mode.                                                                                                                             |
| `mesh:` link syntax (view)     | —     | Small  | MarkdownRenderer strips `mesh:` URLs, renders display text with emoji. Location links may show map widget.                                                                                                                                      |
| Slash commands emit `mesh:`    | —     | Small  | `/time`, `/location`, `/skills` overlays emit `mesh:` link syntax instead of emoji+text. Remove `chipMetadata` sidecar.                                                                                                                         |

| `/hidden` command              | —     | Small  | Inserts `\|\|...\|\|` block with cursor inside. Added to slash command registry.                                                                                                                                                                |
| Discover filter by connections | —     | Small  | Toggle in Discover feed to show only postings from connections. Simple query filter + UI toggle.                                                                                                                                                |
| Remove chips & nudges remnants | —     | Small  | Clean up any remaining quick chip / post-write nudge code (deliberately removed, now spec-deferred).                                                                                                                                            |
| Text-first profile redesign    | —     | Large  | Replace form-based profile with unified MeshEditor. Skills/location/interests extracted from text. Slash commands for profile context (`/skills`, `/location`, `/availability`, `/calendar`, `/update`). No view/edit toggle — always editable. |
| Profile calendar promotion     | —     | Medium | Move calendar connect UX from Settings into Profile's availability section. Busy blocks overlay inline. Calendar visibility settings accessible from profile.                                                                                   |
| Settings page slimming         | —     | Small  | Remove calendar from Settings. Move sign out to regular action (not danger zone). Danger zone = delete account only.                                                                                                                            |
| Mobile command bottom sheet    | —     | Medium | "/" button near editor opens bottom sheet with command list on mobile. Replace cursor-position dropdown. Fix touch handling (`onPointerDown`).                                                                                                  |
| `/update` command              | —     | Medium | NL instruction command for profile context. Takes inline argument or opens inline text input. LLM applies changes to profile text + re-extracts structured fields.                                                                              |

### v0.7 — Spaces Phase 1: Structural Rewrite

The core model change. After Phase 1, the app is a messenger with Spaces, posting-messages, and the existing matching/invite machinery. Subsumes the old v0.7 (Command Palette) — useful items folded in or deferred to backlog. See [1-spaces.md](1-spaces.md) and [designs/spaces-rewrite.md](designs/spaces-rewrite.md) §16.

### v0.9 — Mobile (Capacitor, Android)

Minimal native Android shell wrapping the hosted web app. iOS deferred — PWA covers iOS users.

**Approach:** Hosted URL mode — the Capacitor WebView loads `https://meshit.app`. See [mobile_support_capacitor.md](../.prompts/mobile_support_capacitor.md) for UX considerations.

## Explorations

Design areas that need deeper thinking before they become milestones. See `designs/` for detailed notes.

- **Spaces rewrite** — replaces the posting-centric model with a messenger-like interface where the fundamental unit is the Space. Full design in `designs/spaces-rewrite.md`. Phases 1 and 2 are now milestones v0.7 and v0.8.
- **Continuous profile building & failure-driven context capture** — profiles grow from usage (postings, acceptances, rejections) rather than upfront forms. Coordination failures (no matches, cancelled invites, exhausted sequences) become prompts for adding constraints or profile context. See `designs/continuous-profile-and-failure-recovery.md`.

## Backlog (Unprioritized)

These are ideas without a target milestone. They'll be prioritized as the product evolves:

- Auto-location detection (#16) — detect user location from IP for matching defaults
- Real-time voice upgrade — streaming voice input (OpenAI Realtime, Gemini Live)
- Auto-generated thumbnails — generate posting thumbnails from text via Gemini
- Analytics dashboard for posting owners
- iOS Capacitor build — Apple Developer account, Xcode signing, App Store listing (deferred; PWA covers iOS)
- Standardize date formatting across the app (#44)
- Add skeleton/spinner loading states for slow connections (#48)
- Configurable matching weights — weight sliders per posting (revisit after deep matching)
- Quick chips (deferred) — context-sensitive suggestion chips below text field. Revisit when core flow is polished.
- Post-write nudges (deferred) — LLM suggests missing dimensions. Revisit when core flow is polished.
- Email auth fix (SMTP) (#37) — configure Supabase SMTP for confirmation emails
- Centralize API endpoint paths — ~21 files still use raw `fetch("/api/...")` strings instead of going through a shared constants module (like SWR cache keys). Consolidate to prevent drift when API routes are renamed.

## Update Protocol

### Versioning Scheme

- **Semver**: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (currently `0.x.y`, pre-launch)
- **Minor bump** (`0.x.0`): when a milestone's features are complete and merged to `main`
- **Patch bump** (`0.x.y`): bug fixes and small improvements merged to `main`
- **Major bump** (`1.0.0`): public launch
- **Where tracked**: `package.json` version field + git tags (`v0.2.0`)
- **When to tag**: on merge to `main` that completes a milestone

### Keeping This File Current

1. **Feature PRs**: when your PR implements or completes a roadmap item, update this file:
   - Mark the item `[x]` and move it to "Implemented"
   - If it was the last item in a milestone, bump the version in `package.json`
2. **New issues**: when opening a GitHub issue for a planned feature, add the issue number to the relevant milestone row
3. **CI enforcement**: a warning is emitted on `feat/` PRs that don't touch this file (non-blocking)
4. **Quarterly review**: revisit milestone assignments and priorities at least once per quarter
